# LAUNCH

After you've followed all previous tutorials, you have the required knowledge  to do your first ros2 launch. For that, you have to follow 3 steps :

- How launch file works ?
- How to setup some information needed for the Launch
- How to run a Launch file


## Launch file

Launch files are code in python, we make them to creating `commands lines` and `launch some nodes`. They are really useful because when we run them we can run a lot of nodes and commands lines at the same time.

All the launch files can be found in the [ros2_control_bringup](https://github.com/Benjamin-Amsellem/ros2_control_bolt/tree/master/ros2_control_bolt_bringup), we can run them separately. For example, we will see the file [bolt_system_position_only.launch.py](https://github.com/Benjamin-Amsellem/ros2_control_bolt/blob/master/ros2_control_bolt_bringup/launch/bolt_system_position_only.launch.py):

When you start a launch file you need to `declare the description` of your launch and inside you declare every argument you need.
After having declared every argument, you `initialize` them with what you  want to do.
At the end, you `launch your argument`, then you run another launch file call [bolt.launch.py](https://github.com/Benjamin-Amsellem/ros2_control_bolt/blob/master/ros2_control_bolt_bringup/launch/bolt.launch.py). And in this launch you’ll see the same structure and at the end you run 5 different `Nodes` and run some `commands`.

If you need to launch a `real time node`, you must call them as a `Owner user` with the `sudo` command.

## Setup some command for Launch File

You may need to setup 2 things to run a launch file :

1.  Problem with a ghost node :

    - If you do this command when nothing is run :

		    ros2 node list

       And you see a `ghost node` (if nothing is running, you should see nothing, if the command return something it's a ghost). You need to add this in your `bashrc` :

		        export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=10

2.  Sudo / User talk :

    When you run a launch file with a node in sudo (in real time), the sudo user and your user can't talk to each other. To resolve this problem, you have to add a file inside your directory.

    Don't panic, the file is already add in the bolt directory [FastRTPS.xml](https://github.com/Benjamin-Amsellem/ros2_control_bolt/blob/master/ros2_description_bolt/config/FastRTPS.xml). But you have to call him every time you run a launch file, for that add this command in your `bashrc` :

		    export FASTRTPS_DEFAULT_PROFILES_FILE=<PATH_TO_THE_FILE>

    Where `<PATH_TO_THE_FILE>` is your path to the file `FasrRTPS.xml` from the root `"cd /"`. For example for bolt the right command is :

    		export FASTRTPS_DEFAULT_PROFILES_FILE=users/local/<User_Name>/Bolt_ws/src/ros2_control_bolt/ros2_description_bolt/config/FastRTPS.xml

    **After that, you know every thing, and you have set every thing to run your first launch file.**


## Run Launch File

Now you can really play with Bolt, if you have followed correctly each tutorial  you will be able to `run a Launch File`.

1)  Open a new Terminal and source ros, go to the `Bolt_ws` directory :

	    source install/setup.bash

2)  Colcon build if you have made some modifications, open a new Terminal go on Bolt_ws directory and do :

	    colcon build

3)  Run your first Ros2 launch, in the Terminal where you have sourced Ros, do :

	    sudo ls

	    ros2 launch ros2_control_bolt_bringup bolt_system_position_only.launch.py

    You have first do a `sudo ls` since you need to  be in `sudo mode`.

    **ALWAYS be ready to push the emergency button if the robot makes wrongs moves or for other emergency.**

4) Normally `rviz` it's open, you can see the robot in `real time`.

    Play with it to see all these functionalities.

5) You can run a topic to see all the parameters of Bolt :

    - open a new Terminal, source ros and do :

            ros2 topic list

        you will see that list :

	![Topic List](https://github.com/Benjamin-Amsellem/ros2_control_bolt/blob/master/ros2_control_bolt_tuto/pictures/Launch_Bolt_1-R.png?raw=true "Topic List")

    -  run the topic `/joint_states` :

			ros2 topic echo /joint_states

	![/join_states](https://github.com/Benjamin-Amsellem/ros2_control_bolt/blob/master/ros2_control_bolt_tuto/pictures/Launch_Bolt_2-R.png?raw=true "/join_states")

	**You can see all the parameters of Bolt in real time !**


   **If you want, you can play with all others Topics to see what they published.**

### Now you can start the last tutorial for know how to give some position to Bolt.
