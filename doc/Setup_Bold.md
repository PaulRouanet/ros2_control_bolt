# SETUP


 After  having followed the Starting tutorial, you need to know how to setup Bolt, this will take you 3 steps :


* Bolt skeleton
* How to plug correctly Bolt
* How to setup some information for bolt



##  1)  Bolt Skeleton :


 Bolt is a small robot that has been totally built in our laboratories. We assembled its components, modeled its bones with a `3D printer` and gave it the appearance of real robots.


- If ever a `bone` in his body should `break`, you will have to go to this link and follow the tutorial. You will then have to `print a new bone` for Bolt with a 3D Printer :

##  2)  Plug Bolt properly :

1) For any command that needs Bolt, you must first have it properly connected. The process is simple, and for that you would need:

    - A `power supply`,
    - A pc with `Ubuntu 20.04` and `2 or more Ethernet port`,
    - An `emergency stop button`,
    - A `power cable`.

2) Take your `power supply`, turn it on and adjust behind the power supply the port (P1/P2/P3) and set the mode to `SET` then set the voltage to `20V` and the amperage to `5A` on the front. Finally, set the mode to `NORMAL`.

3) Connect the `emergency stop button` to the `power supply` (from behind,and not in front) :

    ![Behind](https://github.com/Benjamin-Amsellem/ros2_control_bolt/blob/master/ros2_control_bolt_tuto/pictures/Setup_Bolt_3-R.jpeg?raw=true "Behind")

4) Connect the other end of the `emergency button` to the robot and the `Ethernet cable` to your computer.

5) Connect the `power cable` to `Bolt`, one end to the Ethernet port of the `Master-Board` and the `power cable inside Bolt`.

    ![Bolt Connection](https://github.com/Benjamin-Amsellem/ros2_control_bolt/blob/master/ros2_control_bolt_tuto/pictures/Setup_Bolt_4-R.jpeg?raw=true "Connection")

6) Check if any cable is `plugged out` of the `Master-Board` (below Bolt).

7) Finally, `unlock the emergency stop button` and `power on` the `supply power`.

   - If you see a `Red-Light flash` below Bolt, it means Bolt is **ON**


**Now Bolt is connected properly to your computer.**


## 3) Set some important information on Bolt :

1) You need to set the `internet port` of Bolt in the code.

   - Open a Terminal and run :

          ifconfig

2) All the name ports starting with `"en"` you can see them on the left of your terminal.

    - Power ON Bolt.

    - Open a new Terminal, go to your `Bolt_ws` file and `source` your ROS 2 :

          source install/setup.bash

     - Try one by one all the port with this command,  `<PORT>` is a value where you change the `port name` :

            ros2 run --prefix="sudo -E env PATH=${PATH} LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH} PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}" ros2_hardware_interface_bolt demo_bolt_sensor_reading <PORT>

3) When you have no errors, and you have some  `returned values`, you have found the correct port.

      - Copy and paste the right port in the file :

             Bolt_ws/src/ros2_control_bolt/ros2_description_bolt/config/bolt_config.yaml
        at :

              interface : <PORT>     (line 4)

4) Save your file and now you donâ€™t need to put the port name in every command you send to Bolt.

    **Now you have seen how you put the right Ethernet Port in the code.**

### Your next step is to run some tests to see how the Bolt works.
